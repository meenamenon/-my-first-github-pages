    <h2>See the Sights of San Francisco</h2>
    <p>The precipitous hills in San Francisco  make it a city best explored by public transport. Grab a <a href="http://www.sfmta.com/cms/mfares/passports.htm" target="_blank">Muni Passport</a>, and  ride the buses, streetcars, Metro, and—of course—the historic cable cars.</p>
    <p>One of the best ways to get familiar  with the city is to ride the Powell-Mason or Powell-Hyde cable car from Market  Street. This takes you through Union Square, up over Nob Hill, through  <a href="http://www.sanfrancisco.travel/" target="_blank">Chinatown</a>, down to the waterfront at <a href="http://www.fishermanswharf.org/" target="_blank">Fisherman</a>'s Wharf. Stop off at Chinatown  to soak in the unique atmosphere of the largest Chinatown outside Asia. And if  Chinese food sets your mouth watering, there are nearly 200 authentic Chinese  restaurants to choose from.</p>
    <p>If you prefer seafood, then you&rsquo;ll love  Fisherman's Wharf. Even if you&rsquo;re not hungry, just stroll around the waterfront  looking at the fishing boats and watching sea lions basking in the sun. Out in  the Bay lies <a href="http://www.alcatrazcruises.com/index.aspx" target="_blank">Alcatraz</a> (the Rock), once home to notorious criminals, including  Al Capone.</p>
    <p>To visit Alcatraz, it&rsquo;s advisable to  book the ferry tickets online because they usually sell out about a week in  advance. You&rsquo;re left free to wander around the Rock and the former federal  prison. Budget about two and a half hours for the trip, and be prepared for  changeable weather.</p>
    <p>If you can't get tickets for Alcatraz,  take one of the many boat trips around San Francisco Bay. They take you around  the Rock and out to the Golden Gate Bridge, another iconic symbol of the city.</p>
    <p>Just a few ideas to get you started  exploring this fascinating city.</p>

  <h2>Tourist Information</h2>
  <p>There&rsquo;s no shortage of information  about what to see while in San Francisco. The San Francisco Visitor Information  Center is the official travel and visitors&rsquo; guide to the city, with information  in 14 languages.</p>
  <p>Among the many unofficial sites, the <a href="http://www.lonelyplanet.com/usa/san-francisco" target="_blank">Lonely  Planet</a> guide to San Francisco is packed with useful information.</p>
  <h2>Sightseeing <a href="http://www.electrictourcompany.com/" target="_blank">Tours</a></h2>
  <p>One way to see the city is on an  open-top bus, a hop-on, hop-off service that offers either prerecorded or live  commentary. The route goes over the Golden Gate Bridge, giving stunning views  across the city (as long as it&rsquo;s not shrouded in fog!)</p>
  <p>If you&rsquo;re feeling more energetic,  several companies offer bicycle rental. You can even cycle across the Golden  Gate Bridge on the wide bike path.</p>
  <p>And for something completely different…  Why not see the city on a Segway?</p>
